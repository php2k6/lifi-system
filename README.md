# LiFi Communication System

## Overview

This project implements a Light Fidelity (LiFi) communication system that can be implemented using any microcontroller platform including ESP8266/ESP32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, STM32, or other development boards. LiFi is a wireless communication technology that uses visible light instead of radio waves to transmit data. This implementation demonstrates unidirectional data transmission through modulated LED light signals and photodiode reception.

**ðŸ”§ Implementation**: For this project, we used **ESP8266** and **Arduino Uno** microcontrollers to demonstrate the versatility and cross-platform compatibility of the LiFi communication protocol.

**ðŸ“– Featured Publication**: This project is featured in the **Electronics For You** monthly magazine (August 2025 edition) and will be available online soon with detailed implementation guide and technical insights.

## Code Structure

### Transmitter Side (`TRANSMITTER_SIDE.ino`)

#### Key Functions:
- `setup()`: Initializes LED pin and serial communication
- `loop()`: Continuously monitors for input and transmits data
- `transmitString()`: Handles string transmission character by character
- `transmit_byte()`: Transmits individual characters using bit manipulation

#### Core Logic:
```cpp
// Start bit (LED OFF)
digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);

// Data bits (8-bit character)
for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, (byte & (1 << i)) != 0);
    delay(BITDELAY);
}

// Stop bit (LED ON)
digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
```

### Receiver Side (`RECEIVER_SIDE.ino`)

#### Key Functions:
- `setup()`: Initializes serial communication
- `loop()`: Monitors for start bit and decodes incoming data
- `get_bit()`: Reads photodiode state and converts to binary
- `get_byte()`: Assembles 8 bits into complete character

#### Core Logic:
```cpp
// Detect start bit (falling edge)
if (!current_state && previous_state) {
    // Read 8 data bits
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        byte = byte | (get_bit() << i);
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Data Reception
- **Check connections**: Verify photodiode and LED wiring
- **Alignment**: Ensure LED points directly at photodiode
- **Distance**: Move devices closer (< 30cm initially)
- **Ambient light**: Reduce room lighting

#### Garbled/Incorrect Data
- **Timing issues**: Verify BITDELAY values match
- **Signal strength**: Increase LED brightness or reduce distance
- **Interference**: Shield from other light sources
- **Serial monitor**: Check baud rate settings

#### Intermittent Communication
- **Power supply**: Ensure stable power to both microcontrollers
- **Connections**: Check for loose wires
- **Environmental**: Avoid vibrations affecting alignment

### Performance Optimization

1. **Increase LED brightness**: Use higher current (with appropriate resistor)
2. **Improve photodiode sensitivity**: Add amplification circuit
3. **Optimize timing**: Fine-tune BITDELAY for your setup
